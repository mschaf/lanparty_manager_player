# Lanparty Manager Music Player

This python script is used as a music player deamon for my lanparty manager.
It supports playback from youtube and spotify. For the latter a binary spotify api key is requried for lib_spotify. These are not issued anymore, so either you have an old one laying around or borrow one from another project. ;)

I tried runnning it on a PI3 but had issues with lagging spotify playback, so for me a faster computer was required.
